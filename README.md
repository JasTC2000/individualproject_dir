Jasmine TC individual project README file 

Project Overview: This project looks at the data generated from my PhD project
on the expression of the fluorescent protein mCherry. I have used python to clear up the data that was output from the plate reader and visualised it. 
A more detailed report of the project can be found on the word doc submitted. 

Setup/Execution  Instructions: To view this project first clone this directory onto your device. 
All code for this project can be found in the notebook in the repository. 
The code has been annotated and combined with markdown cells to guide you. 
All data has been saved in the repository in the data sub file and linked using
a relative links. The images folder relates to images enter into markdown
cells.  
Any packages or dependencies required are listed and annoated in the notebook 
as they are required. Please run each cell in order as you work through the notebook. 

Data Description: The data for this project are all located in the data sub file.
They are all in a CSV format and are linked into the notebook as required. 
The data used is from a plate reader and show the fluorescence for each well
 in a 96 well plate over 21 hours. Fluorescence (FI) was read every 10 minuets. 

Environment Consistency: Python version Python 3.12.7
| packaged by Anaconda, Inc. | (main, Oct  4 2024, 08:22:19) [Clang 14.0.6 ]
